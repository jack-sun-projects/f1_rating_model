Formula 1 has always been a difficult sport to assess from a statistical perspective. Although teams have huge amounts of data to work with (and undoubtedly are doing so), practically none of it is publicly accessible. Additionally, Formula 1 is and always has been an engineering competition first, and a driving competition second, a fact that is often forgotten by fans of the sport. The speed of competing cars in any given season can vary drastically, which greatly restricts our ability to easily assess driver talent. In other sports such as basketball or soccer, we can at least be assured that the playing field is relatively even. However, in Formula 1 we can only compare drivers to those who drive the same car as them - their teammates, which significantly lessens the number of comparisons that we can perform for each driver, not helped by the fact that for much of Formula 1's history, each team only fielded a pair of drivers at any given race. It is with this approach that we attempt to derive a driver's true talent level independent of factors that are outside their control.
