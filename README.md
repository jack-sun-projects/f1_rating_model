This project trains a logistic GAM to predict driver finishing positions in all Formula 1 races. The model is able to predict a driver's finishing position with a mean error of ~2 using a combination of driver, constructor, age, experience, and other factors. The model can then generate driver performance rankings annually or historically by normalizing for non-driver related factors. These rankings can be printed by running the program. By the model's estimation, the three greatest drivers of all time by their best three best consecutive years are Max Verstappen, Michael Schumacher, and Lewis Hamilton.
